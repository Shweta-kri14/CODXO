            <h2>Dr. A.P.J. Abdul Kalam</h2>
            <h5>(October 15, 1931—July 27, 2015)</h5>
            <hr>
            <p>Dr. APJ Abdul Kalam, affectionately known as the "People's President," was a beacon of inspiration and hope. Born into modest beginnings on October 15, 1931, in Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu, he soared to great heights as a brilliant scientist and a beloved leader. His work on India's missile and space programs earned him the title "Missile Man of India." 
            </br>
            </br>
               Beyond his scientific achievements, Dr. Kalam touched countless hearts with his humility, kindness, and unwavering dedication to education. He believed in the power of dreams and ignited minds with his words and actions. His presidency (2002-2007) was marked by a genuine connection with the youth and a vision for a brighter, developed India.
            </br>
            </br>
               Dr. Kalam's legacy lives on in his books, his speeches, and the millions of lives he inspired. He once said, "Dream, dream, dream. Dreams transform into thoughts and thoughts result in action." Dr. Kalam's life was a testament to this belief, reminding us all to dream big, work hard, and stay grounded in our values.
